As [predicted](/blog/info/2014/11/21/go-west-when-no-one-else-does.html), traffic on Tuesday was bad. Real bad. Of course, it was not possible to predict a [rolled-over tractor trailer][rollover] at the most inopportune portion of the Massachusetts Turnpike, near Charlton.  Due to the [rollover][rollover], heavy traffic lasted from 1 pm until after midnight, instead of the expected 2 pm until 10 pm timeframe.

**What Was the Traffic Impact?**

We visualized speeds (in mph) on the Massachusetts Turnpike; each segment (Boston at the top, Sturbridge at the bottom) is colored from red (slow) to green (fast):

The numbers in the image above correspond to the following:

1. The aforementioned tractor trailer overturns around **2 pm**, shutting down 2 of the 3 lanes; with heavy volumes, the ensuing 3-to-1 merge immediately brings traffic to a halt.
1. The jam backs up at a rate of about 10 miles per hour, and upstream sections of roadway east of Auburn quickly devolve into gridlock around **3 pm**.
1. At the same time, the segment of I-90 east of Route 128 slows down due to normal rush hour traffic, plus holiday travelers.
1. By **4 pm**, even the I-90 segments between 128 and 495 are slowing down.
1. The tractor trailer is cleared around **4 pm**, and the faster speeds cascade through the roadway. On a low-traffic day, speeds would quickly return to normal, but with the high holiday and rush hour volumes, traffic never returns to free-flow.
1. Around **6 pm**, the entire Turnpike from Boston to Sturbridge is a traffic jam.
1. Around **7 pm**, the eastern portion of I-90 returns to normal free-flow as rush hour ends, but the western portion continues to be congested.
1. By about **9 pm**, I-90 east of I-495 finally clears out, and once a segment speeds up, it does so quickly.
1. The section between I-495 and Auburn is mostly clear by 1 pm (still quite late) but 20 mph traffic continues on the road out to Sturbidge until after midnight.

**Why is the Massachusetts Turnpike so prone to heavy traffic?**

The Sturbridge tolls are not the cause; even with heavy westbound I-90 traffic, the ramps leading to the tolls rarely have heavy traffic.  Instead, congestion on the Massachusetts Turnpike near Charlton and Sturbridge is caused by the following:

1.  Vehicles traveling west on I-90 must sort themselves (change into the proper lane) in order to continue west on I-90 or to take the exit ramp to I-84
1.  Vehicles leaving the Charlton Service Plaza must merge with traffic already attempting to sort itself (#1, above); this service plaza also sometimes has a full parking lot, causing vehicles to backup onto I-90W.
1.  Heavy feeder traffic from I-290, I-395 and I-495

Next year? Take the train.
