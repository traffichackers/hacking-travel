TrafficHackers is a website using publicly-available real-time traffic data to analyze past traffic conditions and predict traffic conditions in the future. It began with an entry to the [MassDOT Visualizing Transportation Hackathon][hackathon] in late 2013, and has been in development since then. We use a variety of measures to compare current traffic conditions to previous conditions and model the future. You can use TrafficHackers to easily find current traffic conditions, look at previous average traffic for a specific date and time, and see what our model predicts for the future to plan your route, or compare travel times to alternate transportation modes.

The site is very much still in development, so please contact us if you have any questions or comments. We tweet at [@traffichackers][traffichackers].
